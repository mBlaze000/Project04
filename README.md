# Project 4 - Final

## Description
Project 4: This application is a Task Manager application. It accepts multiple users and tracks their individual tasks.  

## Details for teaching team
The live site is running on Pagodabox. I'm using the built in Laravel validation to check form entries. I've used Javascript and a hidden field to check unique task entries for each user. Record deletion is done using Javascript to confirm whether the user really wants to delete a task. When a user edits a task to complete it, Javascript is used to reveal an entry field for editing the completion date.
